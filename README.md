# CriminAI: Exploring Predictive Analytics for Crime Classification

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately classify the type of crime based on the given features. In this case we have identified the 'Arrest', 'Domestic', and 'Ward' features as our dependent features, which will be used to train our models. The target variable will be 'Primary type'.
Goals for our project include and are not limited to: 
Crime Type Classification:
Train a classification model to predict the type of crime (e.g., theft, assault, battery) based on the features provided. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Feature Importance Analysis:

Determine which features (e.g., 'Arrest', 'Domestic', 'Ward') have the most significant impact on predicting the type of crime. This can help identify key factors influencing criminal activities in different areas.
Model Interpretability:

Use explainable AI techniques to interpret the predictions made by the classification model. Provide explanations for why certain features contribute more to certain types of crimes and visualize the decision boundaries of the model.
Crime Hotspot Detection:

Identify areas (wards) with high frequencies of specific types of crimes using clustering or anomaly detection techniques. This can help law enforcement agencies allocate resources more effectively to prevent and respond to crimes.
Temporal Analysis:

Analyze temporal patterns in crime occurrences over time (e.g., monthly, yearly) to identify trends and seasonality in different types of crimes. This can inform strategies for crime prevention and intervention.
Community Impact Analysis:

Investigate how factors such as arrests, domestic incidents, and ward demographics correlate with different types of crimes. Understand the social and economic factors influencing crime rates in different communities.
